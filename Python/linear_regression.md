1. Without regularization, the estimated function attains a residual error of close to zero but, oscillates a lot and the parameter assumes large positive and negative values, resulting in an over-fitting. Whereas with regularization, the parameters assumes small values, residual error may not be close to zero but, we obtain a much closer approximation of underlying function.
